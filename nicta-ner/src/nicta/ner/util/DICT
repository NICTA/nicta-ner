# Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,

# Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.
# 
# The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
# the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
# common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
# frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
# with Frequency Classification".
# 
# The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

#   From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>
# 
#   > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
#   > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
#   > be lacking any copyright notice.
# 
#   There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
#   "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
#   source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
#   PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
#   domain.
# 
#   Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100
# 
#   > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?
# 
#   That is the intention.
# 
# The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.
# 
# The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
# least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
# words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
# my inflection database.

# 
# The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words words appearing
# in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts

# top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
# list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
# myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
# other word lists is included.
# 
# The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
# don't think can be copyrighted.
#

# 
# The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
# 4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also

# The 60 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and all words
# appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the

# female names and the 3,897 male names from the MWords package.
# 
# The 70 level includes the 74,550 common dictionary words and the
# 21,986 names list from the MWords package The common dictionary words,

# 
# The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
# ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
# Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,
# and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.
